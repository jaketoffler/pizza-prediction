# pizza-prediction

This repository contains a notebook used for the week 6 assignment of Interview Skills, a course in module 3 of the University of San Francisco's Master's in Data Science Program.

The goal of this notebook is to predict the size and toppings of a pizza delivery order using several seemingly uncorrelated features.

If you would like to reproduce the output, please email jake.toffler@gmail.com for the necessary data.
